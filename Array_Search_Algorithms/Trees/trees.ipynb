    "##  Data Indexing\n",
    "Example: Search engines and autocomplete features.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "Trees like Tries are used to store strings for efficient prefix-based queries.\n",
    "For example, in an autocomplete feature, the tree stores all possible prefixes.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Extremely fast lookups for large datasets.\n",
    "Perfect for applications needing dynamic or real-time suggestions.\n",
    "Example Structure (Trie for words “cat” and “car”):\n",

    "# III. Tree Operations (60 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insertion (20 minutes)\n",
    "\n",

    "Example: Show an insertion sequence in a BST with a small dataset.\n",
    "Hands-On Exercise: Have students implement a BST insertion function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Traversal (25 minutes)\n",

    "Hands-On Exercise:\n",
    "Code an in-order traversal, then practice pre-order or post-order if time allows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deletion in a BST (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explain Deletion Cases:\n",
    "Case 1: Node with no children (leaf node).\n",
    "Case 2: Node with one child.\n",
    "Case 3: Node with two children (replace with in-order successor).\n",
    "Example: Show deletion examples with each case using diagrams.\n",
    "Due to time constraints, focus on conceptual understanding rather than full implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# IV. Practical Applications and Q&A (15 minutes)\n",
